## To perform QR Code and Bar Code detection using OpenCV in Python, you can follow these steps:
### Step 1.Open the terminal in PyCharm and run the following commands to install the required libraries:
Make sure you have OpenCV installed. You can install it using:

* pip install opencv-python
* pip install pyzbar
###   Step 2.Create a Python File:
  * In PyCharm, create a new Python file by right-clicking on your project, selecting New -> Python File, and give it a meaningful name, for example, barcode_qr_detection.py.
  ###  Step 3.Write the code
  ###  Step 4.Adjust the Image Path:Replace 'path/to/your/image.jpg' with the actual path to the image you want to use for testing.
  ###  Step 5.Run the Code:
Right-click anywhere in the editor and choose Run 'barcode_qr_detection'. This will execute the script, and you should see the output in the PyCharm console.
### Step 6.View the Results:
After the script has run, PyCharm will display the results in separate windows for QR code detection and barcode detection.

###  Remember to have an image with QR codes and/or barcodes for testing. Adjustments can be made based on specific requirements or use cases.
